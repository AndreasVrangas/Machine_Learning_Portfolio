# Machine_Learning_Portfolio

Purpose of this repository is the exhibition of my work in a series of Machine Learning Datasets.Each project is going to have a series of unique components. These are: 
1. The dataset on which the project is set up.
2. A brief description of the dataset and its manipulation.
3. A brief description of the model to be used along with some comments on its attributes.
4. Parts of code for each project (R or Python).
5.Anything else I may find useful to add/comment.
